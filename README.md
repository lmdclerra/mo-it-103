# MO-IT-103 - Computer Programming 2
Term 3  SY 2023 - 24  Bachelor of Science in Information Technology  A1101

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

In Computer Programming 2, learners gain a more in-depth understanding of programming, testing, debugging, and project management concepts and methods covered in Computer Programming 1. Advanced programming techniques are also covered in this course, such as the use of advanced data types, collection frameworks, event-driven programming, and exception handling.


Learners will also be introduced to the concept of Software Change Requests (SCR), which opens them to other concepts of software development and project management processes. Practice problems are assigned to help the learners hone their programming skills and prepare them for the course's expected outputs and milestones.


## COURSE OUTCOMES

Assess the details of change requests and assign them a priority level.
Modify an existing application according to the specifications listed in the change request document.
Create, test, and debug programs that handle exceptions, use files as input and output sources, and have user interfaces.

## TERMINAL ASSESSMENT AND MILESTONES

Learners improve their output from Computer Programming 1 by enhancing MotorPH's employee application. However, the application requirements are increased in this course.  These requirements are listed in a change request document. The learners are prepared to complete this output after accomplishing the following milestones:

Milestone #1:
Feature 1 - MotorPH employee application user interface design

Milestone #2:
Feature 2 - MotorPH employee application with record create functionality
Feature 3 - MotorPH employee application with record update functionality
Feature 4 - MotorPH employee application with record delete functionality

Terminal Assessment Output:
Feature 5 - MotorPH employee application login functionality
MotorPH Employee Application
